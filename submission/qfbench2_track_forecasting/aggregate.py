"""Fixed-roster aggregation for Track 2 (T2-1), and the provenance that proves which roster.

## Executive summary (read this first)

Track 2 is the only ascending track: **lower is better**. That makes the pre-freeze aggregation
exploitable in the most direct way available. `score.py:162-163` added a unit to the mean only
`if verdict.admissible and verdict.score is not None`, and `final_scorer.py:702-720` filtered NaN
composites and averaged the survivors. Measured: five easy cards at 0.10 plus one hard card at 9.00
mean to 1.5833; making the hard card inadmissible means 0.1000. **A 15x rank improvement for
failing on purpose**, and the hardest card is exactly the one worth failing.

The frozen fix (R-2) has two halves and needs both:

* every expected unit resolves to a C4 state and a failure contributes `W = 4.0` while **staying in
  the denominator**; and
* every real score is **clipped into `[0.0, 4.0]`**.

The clip is not decoration. On an unbounded-above metric a bare penalty is still exploitable: a
participant whose honest composite would be 9.00 improves their mean by failing that unit, because
4.0 is better than 9.0. Clipping caps the honest score at exactly the penalty, so failing is never
*strictly better* than trying — the best a deliberate failure can do is tie. `plan.clip()` and
`plan.failure_score_for()` are the Hub's implementations of both halves and this module calls them
rather than restating the arithmetic.

### What this module adds on top of the Hub's `Aggregate.from_results`

Two Track-2-specific refusals, both of which the generic aggregator cannot make because they are
about *how the number was produced* rather than about the roster:

1. **Mixed normalization is refused.** A raw composite and a `ref_scale`-normalized composite are
   different quantities on different scales; averaging them yields a leaderboard whose ordering
   depends on which units happened to carry a scale file. Today only some units have one, so the
   mix is latent rather than live — and it arms the moment the backfill runs.
2. **A card-derived grid cannot be ranked.** `grid_source` must be `"plan"` for every scored row.
   The card travels inside the participant mount; a ranked score graded against it is graded
   against a file on the wrong side of the firewall.
