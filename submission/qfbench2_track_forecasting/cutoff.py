"""Cutoff binding and corpus/panel look-ahead checks, with no sealed value in any output (T2-6).

## Executive summary (read this first)

Track 2 is an as-of construct: the agent may see everything dated on or before `asof` and nothing
after it. Three separate things enforce that, and each of them was found either partial or
leaky.

1. **Binding.** `forecast_meta.json` declares its own `asof`, `unit_id` and `target`. Before the
   freeze the scorer compared the *declared* `asof` against the card's target dates, so a
   submission could declare any as-of it liked as long as it stayed before the targets.
   `bind_metadata` now requires the declared trio to equal the trusted card's exactly. A
   declaration is a claim; binding is what turns it into a checked fact.

2. **Panels.** `cutoff_ok(asof, targets)` is a string comparison over the card's declared target
   dates. **No staged panel row was ever read.** A panel accidentally published with rows past the
   as-of hands the agent the future in the one file it is guaranteed to open.
   `scan_panel_cutoff` reads the actual rows.

3. **Text.** `_check_text_corpus_cutoff` returned *clean* when `corpus_index.json` was absent, and
   otherwise trusted the index — so a document sitting in `text/` but missing from the index was
   never checked. The check was one-directional in both senses.
   `scan_text_corpus_cutoff` requires the index to exist and to match the directory exactly, in
   both directions.

### Where sealed values are, and are not

The card's `target_dates` are sealed: `asof + horizon` is derivable, but the exact realized target
date is the thing `stage_bundle` redacts out of the participant-facing card. Before the freeze
`_g2_cutoff_resource` returned `{"asof": asof, "targets": targets}` straight into
`GateResult.detail`, mitigated on the CodaBench path by a private allowlist and not mitigated at
all on the private path, where it was logged at ERROR and returned inside `error`.

Nothing in this module puts a date in a participant-visible structure. Refusals carry a frozen
`cutoff_violation` code and integer counts; the dates live only in the operator-only `reason`.
`resolves_after` — the other channel by which a sealed Track 2 date reached a public artifact — is
gone from the Hub allowlist and is not reintroduced here under any name, because the public
projection has no key that accepts a string at all.
