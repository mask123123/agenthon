"""Reference-scale normalization: a rankability invariant, not a convenience (T2-7).

## Executive summary (read this first)

The Track 2 composite is `0.5*marginal + 0.3*joint + 0.2*tail`, and the three components live on
different natural scales — a CPI-index CRPS and a 30-year-yield CRPS differ by orders of
magnitude. Without normalization the mean over the roster is a weighted average dominated by
whichever units happen to carry the largest numbers, so a participant's rank depends on which
instruments the organizers picked. `ref_scale.json` divides each component by the official M0
baseline's value for that unit, which puts every unit on one scale where **the baseline is 1.0 by
construction**. That is what makes `W = 4.0` mean something ("four times worse than a text-blind
random walk") and what makes clipping at 4.0 a real bound rather than an arbitrary one.

Three faults are closed here, all armed and not yet live:

* `hydrate_ctx` built the scale from **whichever keys were present**, and `crps.crps_composite`
  then indexed `ref_scale["marginal"]` unconditionally whenever the dict was truthy — so
  `{"tail": 1.0}` raised an uncaught `KeyError` out of the scorer.
* `hydrate_ctx` ended with `ctx.setdefault("ref_scale", None)`, so a **missing scale file silently
  produced a raw composite**, and the driver then averaged raw and normalized units together with
  nothing refusing the mix.
* "complete" meant all three components positive, but the joint component does not exist on a
  1-cell variogram grid, so the correct scale (`joint: 0.0`) was unloadable — 60 of 104 public
  cards. Latent only because the generator writes a placeholder `1.0` there; it arms the moment
  the scales are regenerated honestly. `load_ref_scale` now takes the grid shape and the joint
  statistic. See `_OPTIONAL_COMPONENT`.

All three are now impossible by construction: `load_ref_scale` returns a complete scale or raises,
and `NormalizationMode` has no third value that means "whatever we found on disk".

Ranked callers additionally use `load_verified_ref_scales(plan, ref_root)` once for the entire
roster. It checks the plan's commitment to the exact file bytes and returns an immutable snapshot.
Unit verifiers parse that snapshot; they never reopen scales after verification. Staging uses
`read_ref_scale_bundle(ref_root, handles).commitment`, so both paths share the digest encoding.

### The firewall note that matters more than the arithmetic

`ref_scale.json` is **answer-equivalent**. It is derived from the sealed realized outcome — it is
the baseline's error against that outcome — so given the baseline's forecast it inverts to the
target. It looks innocuous (three floats, no dates, no identifiers) and it is *not* the answer
file, which is precisely why a tool classifying unit files by name will ship it as configuration.
C6 has `answer_equivalent: bool` for exactly this artifact. `assert_reference_only()` below is the
scorer-side restatement: the loader refuses to read a scale out of anything but the reference root.
