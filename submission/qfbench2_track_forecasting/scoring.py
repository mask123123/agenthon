"""Track 2 canonical scorer — the gate stack, the metric, and the one flattening rule.

## Executive summary (read this first)

This module is the **single** Track 2 scoring implementation. The private final scorer and the
CodaBench scoring image both import it as an installed package; neither reimplements it and
neither reaches it through an ambient sibling checkout. That is T2-7/T2-17: before the freeze
`final_scorer.py` did `sys.path.insert(0, <repo>/../track2-forecasting-public/scoring)` and
`import scoring`, so whatever happened to be checked out next door became the production gate
stack, under a generic top-level module name that also shadowed any installed `scoring`.

Canonical contract, unchanged and still what the shared smoke runner imports:

    build_verifier(ctx) -> qfbench2_common.verifier.HierarchicalVerifier
    LEADERBOARD_SORT     -> "asc"   (lower composite is better)

### What changed at the freeze, and why each one is structural rather than a patch

* **g1 no longer fails open.** `except ModuleNotFoundError: pass` around `jsonschema.validate`
  meant that on a host without `jsonschema` a garbage sidecar passed — and because the 200-draw
  floor lived only in the schema, that one `pass` removed the floor entirely. A missing validator
  is now an `OrganizerFault`, and the floor is *also* enforced in code (`limits.min_draws`) so it
  survives any single point of failure.
* **`representation: parametric` is refused.** The schema advertised it and promised `cov.parquet`;
  nothing anywhere read `cov.parquet`, and the `n_draws` requirement was conditional on
  `representation == "samples"` — so `parametric` with **3 draws** was fully admissible while the
  same 3 draws under `samples` were rejected. Track 2 does not maintain a divergent copy of the
  Hub's schema, so the accepted-representation narrowing lives here until the Hub lands the schema
  change (filed as a contract request).
* **No participant-authored parse error escapes as a crash.** `json.loads` and `read_parquet` were
  unguarded and `score.py` called the verifier inside the unit loop with no `try`, so one malformed
  sidecar killed the whole submission as an organizer-shaped crash instead of producing one
  participant failure. Every read here is bounded and every parser exception becomes a `T2Refusal`.
* **The grid comes from C1, in order.** See `grid.py`.
* **There is no raw-composite fallback.** See `normalization.py`.
* **No detail carries free text.** See `failures.py`.

    # The variogram is a between-cells statistic: on a 1-cell grid it is 0 by construction,
    # not by merit, so its weight deflates the composite and the documented anchor breaks --
    # the frozen baseline lands at exactly w_m + w_t = 0.7 instead of the 1.0 that
    # SCORING-AGGREGATION.md promises. Measured on the SHIPPED cards, which anyone can
    # reproduce: 40 of the 71 validation units and 20 of the 33 public-dev units are single-cell,
    # 60 of 104 overall. So the leaderboard mean was averaging two different scales rather than
    # hitting an edge case. Nothing is said here about the sealed split's share. On a 1-cell grid
    # the live
    # weights are renormalized over the components that structurally exist
    # ((0.5, 0.3, 0.2) -> (0.714286, 0, 0.285714)); every multi-cell unit is byte-identical.
    #
    # There is ONE board. An earlier revision of this comment said single- and multi-cell units
    # additionally rank on separate boards combined by rank average; that ruling was withdrawn
    # (track-lead, 2026-08-25) because the scoring program emits one statistic and the live
    # leaderboard has nowhere to put a per-board field -- publishing it would have promised
    # participants a number the platform cannot show them. The renormalization above is what makes
    # one board fair: it puts the text-blind baseline at 1.0 on both card shapes, so a single
    # average is averaging one quantity. Ruling and measurements: the private repo's
    # docs/SCORING-AGGREGATION.md.
    #
    # The rule is justified BY THE VARIOGRAM being 0, not by the cell count: `energy_score` on a
    # 1-cell grid equals the marginal CRPS, so zeroing its weight would silently discard a defined
    # component of the composite (measured: a 1.27x error). Refuse rather than discard.
