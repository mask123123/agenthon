"""The one official Track 2 entrypoint, shared by the private final scorer and the scoring image.

## Executive summary (read this first)

T2-7 asks for "one canonical package consumed by private final and the scoring image". This module
is that consumption point: it takes the two roots the frozen worker/scoring topology guarantees and
returns a complete, aggregated, provenance-stamped result.

    input/ref/    organizer, read-only: evaluation_plan.json (signed, expanded), trust_store.json,
                  and one directory per unit holding card.toml plus reference/ (realized.parquet,
                  ref_scale.json)
    input/res/    the ingestion output root: <unit_handle>/ sanitized participant bytes,
                  plus _control/ (run_records/, observations/, logs/)

Four properties make this the *official* path rather than merely a convenient one.

1. **The roster is the plan's, not the filesystem's.** The loop is over `plan.expected_handles`.
   A directory present under `input/res/` that the plan does not commit to is an organizer fault;
   a committed unit with no directory is a participant failure with `no_output`, which still
   occupies its slot in the denominator. Neither can change the denominator, which is A01.
2. **Fault domains are separated at the top of the loop, not at the bottom.** A `T2Refusal` becomes
   one participant-failure row. An `OrganizerFault` propagates out of the whole function and the
   caller publishes nothing — the frozen `abort_whole_evaluation` policy. Before the freeze a
   malformed participant sidecar raised `JSONDecodeError` straight out of g0 and killed the entire
   submission as an organizer-shaped crash.
3. **Every participant-visible byte goes through the Hub redactor.** `details.jsonl` is written by
   `qfbench2_common.failure_labels.report(..., sink="public")`, whose default projection is enum
   code plus integer counts. The operator log is a separate sink at a separate path and the caller
   owns where that path points.
4. **Normalization uses committed bytes.** Before any participant gate runs, the entire scale
   roster is read once and its commitment checked against the plan. Each unit parses those
   immutable bytes. A later file replacement cannot change a verified denominator.
